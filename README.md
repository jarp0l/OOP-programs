My programming works of C/C++/OOP BECIE I/II (Assignments, Lab)

# How to navigate in this repo?

All the programs have been classfied according to their types(i.e. whether assignment or lab work). So, for instance, programs/tasks from lab are in [LAB](./LAB/) folder and this has again been divided according to the lab number, for example: [lab-1](./LAB/lab-1), lab-2, etc. And the programs have been named according to the lab number. For example, the name of program 1 from lab 1 is: l1.1.c
